Door Code Notifier
==================

An Android app that notifies you when you're near a friend's place, to show you their door code.

No longer will you have to look for the code, or call your friend: the information will automatically come
to you when and where you need it!  The notification also presents handy 'Text' and 'Call' quick actions.

This app is compatible and works well with Android Wear.
